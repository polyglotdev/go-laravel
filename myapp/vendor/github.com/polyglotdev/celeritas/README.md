# Celeritas

This repo and package are for the [Let's Build a Go version of Laravel
](https://www.udemy.com/course/lets-build-a-go-version-of-laravel) course on Udemy.

I created a full package because I was having trouble with the `go get` command. I wanted to make sure that the package was available to everyone.
